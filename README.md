# Server-Resources-Monitoring-Management-System
Build a system to collect and monitor server resource metrics (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network).  Display real-time status via a dashboard.  Send alerts when thresholds are exceeded (e.g., CPU > 90%, Disk > 80%, RAM overload).  Support monitoring multiple servers from a centralized point.  Scalable to integrate with DevOps / IT Automation.
